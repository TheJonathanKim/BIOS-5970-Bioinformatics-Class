The region captured below illustrates the region on Chromosome 1 defined by the gene XM_037683900.1, named rpl34. According to the scale bar between 33,826 kb and 33,827 kb above the ATAC sequence narrowpeaks peak_510 and peak_349, there is a very large peak in ATAC sequences for both the diapause and larval stage with a similar magnitude. At this point, there is only a short peak for the RNA sequences in both diapause and larval stage.This seems to indicate high peaks in a topologically associated domain when looking at ATAC, but with actual lower expression in both developmental stages due to a lower corresponing RNA peaks.
Conversely, at a region further down the gene between 33824 kb and 33823 kb, there's a comparatively higher peak for RNA sequences with a slightly higher peak for diapause than larval stage. Overall for this gene, regions containing exons show higher peaks in RNA sequence than ATAC sequences.
